Data Visualization on Student Performance Dataset

This project focuses on transforming raw educational data into compelling visual stories using Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The goal was to explore key factors affecting student academic outcomes and provide actionable insights for educators and policy makers.

Objective

To identify patterns and performance drivers—such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation—that influence student scores in math, reading, and writing.

Key Visualizations

* Histogram: Distribution of average student scores
* Bar Plots: Average scores by gender, parental education, and lunch type
* Box Plots: Score spread by test preparation
* Heatmap: Correlation between math, reading, and writing scores
* Scatter Plot: Score relationships by gender
* Interactive Dashboard: Built using Dash & Plotly for live data exploration

Insights Uncovered

* Test preparation improves scores across all subjects
* Socioeconomic status (lunch type) strongly influences academic outcomes
* Parental education level correlates with student performance
* Females outperform in language, while males lead slightly in math
* Reading and writing scores are highly correlated—suggesting curriculum overlap

Tools & Libraries

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for static visuals
* Plotly & Dash for interactive dashboarding
* Google Colab for development

Impact

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in education analytics. By highlighting areas for intervention, it equips educators and stakeholders to make informed, equitable decisions.
